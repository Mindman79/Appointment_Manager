This application is a scheduling application using MySQL for data persistence. It allows a user to create and modify customers and appointments, and display notifications of upcoming appointments. It also maintained an access control log.

The goal of the exercise was to demonstrate proficiency in database connections, lambda functions, exception handing and assertions, localization, and logging.

This application was built using IntelliJ and SceneBuilder.

This project required a MySQL JDBC connector. I used mysql-connector-java-5.1.47.
